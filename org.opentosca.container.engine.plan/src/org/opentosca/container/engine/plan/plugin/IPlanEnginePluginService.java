/**
 * This interface is the superinterface for all plugins used by
 * {@link org.opentosca.planengine.service.impl.PlanEngineImpl}.
 *
 * The plugins are splitted into two types, this is because there are two ways
 * to declare a Plan in Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud
 * Applications Version 1.0 Chapter 11: Plans
 *
 * <li>The {@link IPlanEnginePlanModelPluginService} interface is responsible
 * for PlanModel elements inside the Plan element, the interface specifies
 * plugins which can read the contents of the element and deploy them unto a
 * compatible environment. Example: bash script on linux machine
 *
 * <li>The {@link IPlanEnginePlanRefPluginService} interface is responsible for
 * PlanReference elements inside a Plan element. These elements reference plan
 * implementations which can't be written directly into the ServiceTemplate and
 * are packaged for deployment. Example: WS-BPEL 2.0 Process which has to be
 * deployed unto a WSO2 BPS
 *
 * Deployment of Plans is completely plugin dependend, this means the PlanEngine
 * doesn't say where to deploy/install the plan, this must be handled by the
 * plugin itself.
